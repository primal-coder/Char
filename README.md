# Char

## Description

The Char module is comprised of several submodules that provide functionality for working with (but not limited to) Characters typical to role-playing games, objects that those characters may interact with, take posession of or find and a grid-based game world on which those characters may reside. The submodules are as follows:

* [Char::CharCore](Char/CharCore/README.md)
* [Char::entyty](Char/entyty/README.md)
* [Char::dicepy](Char/dicepy/README.md)
* [Char::gridengine_framework](Char/gridengine/README.md)
* [Char::CharActor](Char/CharActor/README.md)
* [Char::CharObj](Char/CharObj/README.md)
* [Char::CharTask](Char/CharTask/README.md)
